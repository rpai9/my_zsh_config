My Z-shell config

This is how you like the terminal setup on your machines

- Copy the content of zshrc to ~/.zshrc
- Create a dir called `zsh_theme` at home folder and move the content of `zsh_theme` to `~/zsh_theme` on your computer.
- For fonts package installation

  `git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git && cd fonts && ./install.sh'`

  Then run

  `cd .. && rm -rf fonts`
